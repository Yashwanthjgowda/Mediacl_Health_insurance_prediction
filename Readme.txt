Medical Health Insurance Cost Prediction using Linear Regression
This project uses linear regression to predict the cost of medical health insurance based on various personal and health-related features. The model analyzes factors such as age, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking status, and region to estimate the annual insurance premiums.

Key Features:
Dataset: The project uses a dataset containing information about individuals and their health insurance costs.
Target Variable: The target variable is the insurance premium, which is predicted based on the input features.
Features: Features include age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.
Algorithm: Linear Regression is used to model the relationship between the features and the insurance cost.
